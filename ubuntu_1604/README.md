These roles were originally developed as a way for me to practice my ansible skills and as a way to offer cheap server configuration setups to others on fiverr.com.  Nobody ever bought from me and I like sharing, so here is all of the code.  

You can setup:

 - Automatic Updates
 - Fail2ban for ssh protection
 - MySQL
 - LAMP
 - OpenSSL CA
 - Jenkins
 - FTP server
 - Tomcat
 - OpenVPN server

For some of them you can specify multiple users and options.  Additionally, these were built with security in mind.  To learn more about the roles and how to configure the csvs in sample-sales read offers.html.  To learn how to run the ansible playbooks or how to setup a test environment read notes.txt. Enjoy.
